# Things to add

## Module 1: 
### Distibutions
- Relation between distributions and recurrecence intervals of extreme events
- Distributions of Earthquakes / Distributions of Hurricanes / Distributions of precipitation and tornadoes
- Joint Distribution plots (in the continuous random variable lecture). Easiest example is probably Gaussian distribution. Plot conditional and marginal distributions.
- Joint/Conditional Inference (?)
- Poisson distribution could be useful for Earthquakes?
- A discussion of probability modelling
###Moments:
- Mean, median, mode

### Sampling Statistics 
- add an example from precipitation in urbana. samples of different months have different distributions.
- Consider moving Sampling Statstics in Module 2, with the estimators / after hypothesis testing? 


### Slides:
- move the probability models from M01L03 (moments) to the end of M01L02 (random variables)

## Module 2: 
Possible new structure:

Module 1
- Basics of Probability calculus
- Random Variables
- Moments
- Functions of random variables
- Central Limit Theorem & Extreme Value Theorem

- Joint and conditional distributions
- Multivariate Normal Distribution
- Covariances, Correlations, including autocovariances, autocorrelation
- Probability Models

Module 2: Statistical Inference
- Hypothesis Testing
- Estimators and their distributons: Sample Mean, Sample Variance, 

Method of Moments, simulating estimators. 
- Quality of Estimators: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Maximum Likelihood estimators. 
- Univariate Regression
- Multi-variate Regression
- Classification: Logistic regression
- Krigging

Module 3: The good reverend Bayes
- Basics and Bayesian Regression
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- Stan
- Kalman Filter

Module 4: Principles of supervised learning
- Test, Training, Validation (ISLP Chapter 5.1)
- Regularization, linear model selection (ISLP Chapter 6)
- 

Module 6: Neural Nets
- 

Module 7: Unsupervised Learning. 


-demonstrate likelihood for Gamma distribution the way it was demonstrated for gaussian
-numerical estimation of mle, when the derivative is hard to find (?)
-MLE from histogram (when the likelihood does not have a closed form?)
