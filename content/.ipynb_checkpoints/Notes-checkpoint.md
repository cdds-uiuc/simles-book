# Things to add

## Module 1: 
- Relation between distributions and recurrecence intervals of extreme events
- Distributions of Earthquakes / Distributions of Hurricanes / Distributions of precipitation and tornadoes
- Joint Distribution plots (in the continuous random variable lecture). Easiest example is probably Gaussian distribution. Plot conditional and marginal distributions.
- Joint/Conditional Inference (?)
- Poisson distribution could be useful for Earthquakes?
