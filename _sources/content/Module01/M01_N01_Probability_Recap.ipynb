    "\n",
    "We note a couple of things. The Sample space and the event space do not uniquely define the probability. For example, we could have a biased roullete (perhaps using a magnet and a metal ball), such that the ball is more likely to fall on particular numbers. In that case, the probability of individual outcomes in the sample space may not be equal. However, as we discusss more below, the total sum of probabilities across the possible outcomes still has to equal 1, unless there is a chance that the ball falls off the roullete table and none of the outcomes is hit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that outcomes are different from events. A single outcome, e.g. a roullete roll of $\\color{green}{00}$ is associated with multiple possible events. It helps to think of an event as a possible bet , and the event space  as *the space of all possible bets*. Any bet you make on the roullete can be expressed as a subset of $\\mathcal F$, and has a probability associated with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bet on a single number (e.g. on $\\color{red}7$),  also called a straight-up bet. This event is equivalent to the outcome of the roullete being in the set $E_1=\\{\\color{red}1\\}$. The probability of this event is $P(E_1)$=1/38.\n",

    "## Infinite Sample Spaces\n",
    "Why do we need to go through these definitions of event spaces and sample spaces? For probability spaces with a finite number of possibl outcomes we can assign a probability to each outcome and it becomes trivial to compute the probability of events. However, that is no longer the case when we start working with infinite sample spaces, such as an interval on the real line. For example, if the sample space of a random process is the interval $\\Omega=[0,1]\\in \\mathbb R$, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes, and thus not all of them can have finite (non-zero) probability. In that case, we can only assign finite probabilities to sub-intervals, or subsets of the sample space. In other words, *in the most general case we can only assign finite probabilities to member of the event space $\\mathcal E$*. However, the same rules of probabilites apply for both infinite and finite samples spaces, and it is easier to get an intuition for them on small, finite spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "For purposes of this class, we don't need to worry about probability spaces, event spaces, and probability functions. However, simple examples such as these are useful in illustrating some very general properties of probabilities that we *will* use extensively in the class, especially in the chapters on statistical inference and Bayesian data analysis.
