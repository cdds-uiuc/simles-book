# Things to add

## Module 1: 
- Relation between distributions and recurrecence intervals of extreme events
- Distributions of Earthquakes / Distributions of Hurricanes / Distributions of precipitation and tornadoes
- Joint Distribution plots (in the continuous random variable lecture). Easiest example is probably Gaussian distribution. Plot conditional and marginal distributions.
- Joint/Conditional Inference (?)
- Poisson distribution could be useful for Earthquakes?
- A discussion of probability modelling

Slides: move the probability models from M01L03 (moments) to the end of M01L02 (random variables)

## Module 2: 

-demonstrate likelihood for Gamma distribution the way it was demonstrated for gaussian
-numerical estimation of mle, when the derivative is hard to find (?)
-MLE from histogram (when the likelihood does not have a closed form?) 

Move to end? 
% When building statistical estimators, and also for purposes of this class, we will use a lot of synthetic examples where we generate the data ourselves, then use statistical estimators to infer back the parameters that we used to generate the data. In that case, we know the true value of $\theta$ and we just want to see how well our estimator $\hat\theta$ does. 

For real scientific applications we obviously do not know either the true random process that generated the data, or the true value of the paremeters. 

Using synthetic data is important in helping us understand how well an estimator does in recovering the parameter, it does not necessarily tell us what happens if we chose the wrong model.
