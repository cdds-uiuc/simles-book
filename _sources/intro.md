# Statistical Inference and Machine Learning for Earth Sciences
## GEOL 593 / ATMS 597 


This is a live and ***very much beta*** version of the course notes for the GEOL 593/ATMS 597, as the class is being actively taught for the first time in the Spring of 2024 at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. 

```{warning}
If you happened on this website and are not a student in the class, proceed with caution. The book is actively being changed and updated. Nothing is stable. The course is intended as a graduate-level hands-on introduction to Statistical Inference and Machine Learning methods across Earth and Environmental Sciences. You are welcome to play around with the materials but be warned: Here be dragons.
```

## Running code:
```{important}
To run a notebook in this book you can either download the notebook and run it locally, or use the launch button (the little rocket at the top of notebooks) to launch either Google Colab or Binder Hub. 
```

## Errors, Typos, Examples, Feedback
This is the first iteration of the material, written on the fly, as it is being taught, during a pandemic, and while raising an infant. Errors and typos abound. Finding typos and errors *and reporting them to me* will count towards your participation score in the class. Helpful feedback on the presentation is also welcomed. 

Well-written examples applications in the Earth and Environmental Sciences are *especially* welcomed, and will earn participation grade (if a student in the class), or brownie points + eternal gratitude + acknowledgemetns if not. 


## Resources
The class assumes basic knowledge of Python. It will also make use of a number of libraries for scientific computing. The most commonly used packages are <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>,<code>scipy</code> ,<code>scikit-learn</code> , and <code>matplotlib</code>. We will also make ocassional use of <code>xarray</code>, <code>cartopy</code> <code>statsmodel</code>, <code>seaborn</code> and many others. 

The course notebooks will give you ample examples of how to use these libraries, so it is not necessary to be familiar with them beforehand. At the same time, this is not a scientific computing class, so it is assumed that you can read and reproduce scientific computing code, and are able to look up documentations and examples by yourself.

```{Tip}
I *strongly* recommend that before embarking on this class you go through a tutorial or a class on scientific computing in python. My recommendation is 
- Ryan Abernathey's <a ref="https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html">Introduction to Earth and 
Environmental Data Science</a>. <br>
```
The materials is  easily accessed in the same Jupyter Book format as this courses.


## Readings
The course material is supplemented by in-class lecture and additional readings. The recommended reading for the class consists of two freely-available textbooks:
- Julien Emile-Geay: [Data Analysis in the Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://figshare.com/articles/book/Data_Analysis_in_the_Earth_Environmental_Sciences/1014336/10)
- James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani: [An introduction to statistical learning with Python](https://www.statlearning.com/)


Selected reading will be assigned from several other textbooks. All of these are freely available either online or through the UIUC library:
- Dennis Hartmann: [Objective Analysis Course Notes](https://atmos.uw.edu/~dennis/552_Notes_ftp.html) 
- Von Storch and Zwiers: Statistical Analysis in Climate Research [UIUC library link](https://i-share-uiu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CARLI_UIU/gpjosq/alma99653508612205899)
- Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman: [The elements of statistical learning : data mining, inference, and prediction](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)
