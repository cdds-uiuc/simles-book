# About this book

# GEOL 593 / ATMS 597 

This is a live and ***very much beta*** version of the course notes for the GEOL 593/ATMS 597, as the class is being actively taught for the first time in the Fall of 2021 at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. 

```{warning}
If you happened on this website and are not a student in the class, proceed with caution. The book is actively being changed and updated. Nothing is stable. The course is intended as a graduate-level hands-on introduction to Statistical Inference and Machine Learning methods across Earth and Environmental Sciences. You are welcome to play around with the materials but be warned: Here be dragons.
```

This book contains the jupyter-noteboks for the class, and is meant to be supplemented by additional reading, lectures, and course projects.

## Running code:
```{important}
To run a notebook in this book use the launch button (the little rocket at the top of notebooks) to launch either Binder Hub or Google Colab. 
```
```{danger}
If you work in Google Colab on the course-version of the notebook you risk losing your work if you close the interactive session. If you want to work on a notebook, save it, and be able to return to it, make sure you save a copy of the notebook in your own google drive. This can be done in Colab by clicking "save a copy in Drive" under the "File" menu.
```

## Errors, Typos, Examples, Feedback
This is the first iteration of the material, written on the fly, as it is being taught, during a pandemic, and while raising an infant. Errors and typos abound. Finding typos and errors *and reporting them to me* will count towards your participation score in the class. Helpful feedback on the presentation is also welcomed. 

Well-written examples applications in the Earth and Environmental Sciences are *especially* welcomed, and will earn participation grade (if a student in the class), or brownie points + eternal gratitude + acknowledgemetns if not. 


## Resources
The class assumes basic knowledge of Python. It will also make use of a number of libraries for scientific computing. The most commonly used packages are <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>,<code>scipy</code> ,<code>scikit-learn</code> , and <code>matplotlib</code>. We will also make ocassional use of <code>xarray</code>, <code>cartopy</code> <code>statsmodel</code>, <code>seaborn</code> and many others. 

The course notebooks will give you ample examples of how to use these libraries, so it is not necessary to be familiar with them beforehand. At the same time, this is not a scientific computing class, so it is assumed that you can read and reproduce scientific computing code, and are able to look up documentations and examples by yourself.

```{Tip}
I *strongly* recommend that before embarking on this class you go through a tutorial or a class on scientific computing in python. My recommendation is 
- Ryan Abernathey's <a ref="https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html">Introduction to Earth and 
Environmental Data Science</a>. <br>
```
The materials is  easily accessed in the same Jupyter Book format as this courses.


## Readings
The course material is supplemented by in-class lecture and additional readings. The recommended reading for the class consists of two freely-available textbooks:
- Julien Emile-Geay: <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/book/Data_Analysis_in_the_Earth_Environmental_Sciences/1014336/10">Data Analysis in the Earth & Environmental Sciences</a>
- James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani: <a href="â€¢	James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani: An introduction to statistical learning ">An introduction to statistical learning</a>
