# Things to add

## Module 1: 
### Distibutions
- Relation between distributions and recurrecence intervals of extreme events
- Distributions of Earthquakes / Distributions of Hurricanes / Distributions of precipitation and tornadoes
- Joint Distribution plots (in the continuous random variable lecture). Easiest example is probably Gaussian distribution. Plot conditional and marginal distributions.
- Joint/Conditional Inference (?)
- Poisson distribution could be useful for Earthquakes?
- A discussion of probability modelling

### Sampling Statistics 
- add an example from precipitation in urbana. samples of different months have different distributions.
### Slides:
- move the probability models from M01L03 (moments) to the end of M01L02 (random variables)

## Module 2: 
-demonstrate likelihood for Gamma distribution the way it was demonstrated for gaussian
-numerical estimation of mle, when the derivative is hard to find (?)
-MLE from histogram (when the likelihood does not have a closed form?)
